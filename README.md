### Built with
I built this project with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library



### What I learned
I was able to refresh my knowledge of flexbox, and I also got to practice some of the things I learned in React. I also got to work with Media Queries.



### Continued development

I would like to work on more Frontend Mentor projects using React so I can get better.
